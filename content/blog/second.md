I want to create a new language named **cielo** that is an
extension of CoffeeScript with these features:

1. Auto-imports and auto-install via `.symbols` file
2. Statement to allow async code within sync functions
3. multi-type HEREDOC syntax
4. Typing syntax to allow 1) documentation, 2) assertions
5. #include - to include files
6. #define - to define variables
7. __END__ ends a file
8. Allow additional type of quote: « (ALT+0171) » (ALT+0187)
